# Stay-Alive
A turn based, hidden information game for the Jam-O-Drum.The four players are lost at sea on a small raft and must attempt to survive for 7-10 weeks at which point they are rescued.The main mechanic is voting. Every week four players must vote to eat or not as their remaining food dwindles. When food runs out, players can make the difficult choice to cannibalize a boatmate to ensure that someone makes it out alive.

I was the sole programmer in the team. I designed and created the game system in 2 weeks in the 3 week long project for Building Virtual Worlds (BVW), a graduate course in the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at CMU.
